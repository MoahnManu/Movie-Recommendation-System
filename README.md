# Movie Recommendation System üçø

This project is a web-based movie recommendation engine built using a collaborative filtering algorithm. It analyzes user ratings from a movie dataset to suggest new movies to a user based on the preferences of similar users.

## **Project Description**

The goal of this project is to showcase an end-to-end data science workflow, from data preprocessing to building and deploying a machine learning model. The recommendation system is implemented using Python and the Flask framework, providing a simple and interactive user interface where users can get personalized movie suggestions.

## **Key Features**

  * **Collaborative Filtering:** The core of the system uses a collaborative filtering approach to find relationships between users and their movie ratings.
  * **Cosine Similarity:** The model calculates user similarity using cosine similarity on a user-movie matrix, efficiently identifying users with similar tastes.
  * **User-Based Recommendations:** Recommends movies that highly-rated, similar users have enjoyed but the target user has not yet seen.
  * **Interactive Web UI:** A simple web application built with Flask allows users to input a user ID and receive a list of movie recommendations.

## **Technologies Used**

  * **Python:** The primary programming language for the entire project.
  * **Flask:** A lightweight web framework used to create the web application and serve the front-end.
  * **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and transforming the raw ratings data into a usable format.
  * **Scikit-learn:** A machine learning library used for computing the cosine similarity between users.

## **Setup and Installation**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### **Prerequisites**

  * Python 3.x installed.
  * `pip` for installing packages.

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

*(Note: Replace `your-username` and `your-repository-name` with your actual GitHub details.)*

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**

Install all the required Python libraries using `pip`.

```bash
pip install Flask pandas scikit-learn
```

### **Step 3: Download the Dataset**

This project uses the MovieLens dataset. You will need both the `ratings.csv` and `movies.csv` files.

  * Download the datasets from [MovieLens Latest Small Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhammehta21/movie-lens-small-latest-dataset).
  * Place both `ratings.csv` and `movies.csv` directly into the project's root directory.

### **Step 4: Run the Application**

With the files in place, you can now run the Flask application from your terminal.

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start, and you will see a message indicating that the server is running.

### **Step 5: Access the Web App**

Open your web browser and navigate to the following address:
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

You can then enter a user ID from the dataset (e.g., a number between 1 and 610) to get personalized movie recommendations.
